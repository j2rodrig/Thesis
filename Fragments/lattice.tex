The simple TMT lattice consists of the following types:

\begin{center}
	unannotated $\rightarrow$ mutable $\rightarrow$ polyread $\rightarrow$ readonly $\rightarrow$ errortype
\end{center}

Generally, subtype checks do not distinguish between unannotated and mutable. However, the distinction between unannotated
and mutable is important for determining whether or not a piece of code has been intentionally annotated by
the programmer. For example, unannotated type expressions take on a default TMT derived from the components of that
expression (see Type Expressions below).

Polyread types have symbols of origin and TMT adaptations.
