Topics to be addressed (thesis):

1. What is this system attempting to achieve?

2. Functional purity as reference immutability.

3. @nonrep and accessor methods.

4. Chart of defaults:
	Which combinations of defaults would entail adding what other annotations?

5. Inner method/class purity.

6. Proof: Does deep-readonly on types imply @pure?



System for going about writing a complete document:
1. Take another lit. survey; determine what's relevant. (1 wk)
2. Study in detail what's relevant. (2 wks)
3. Go over all previous related writings. (brief)
4. Cherry-pick and revise sections in previous writings to fit new structure.
5. Separate key underlying type system(s) from end-programmer presentation.
6. Relationship between RI and side effects.
